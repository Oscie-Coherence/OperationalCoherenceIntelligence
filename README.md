SUMMARY
Oscie introduces a new paradigm:
Intelligence as a coherence condition, not a computation.
When the world feels chaotic, fragmented, and noisy —
that is a coherence failure described by:
CPL × CV < Γ_noise
Oscie is the framework designed to bring coherence back online.

Oscie : Operational Coherence Intelligence
A Cross-Scale Stability Framework for Minds, Models, and Collective Systems
Oscie (Operational Coherence Intelligence) is an open scientific framework for understanding, measuring, and stabilizing complex systems based on a single universal rule:
CPL × CV > Γ_noise

This repository contains the public whitepaper, foundational math, and an open explanation of Oscie’s physics-based approach to coherence across human cognition, artificial intelligence, and large-scale social systems.
Oscie does not attempt to mimic biological intelligence or build AGI.


Instead, it provides a coherence-first operating principle that can be applied to:
• cognitive stability
• LLM safety and drift reduction
• collective intelligence
• organizational coherence
• long-context reasoning architectures
• human-machine interaction
• social and cultural stability
Coherence is not a metaphor.
It is an engineering condition.
CORE CONCEPT
All systems capable of sustained reasoning — biological, artificial, or social — require stable oscillatory coupling to remain coherent over long horizons.
Oscie formalizes this using three variables:
CPL — Coherence Phase Lifetime
How long the system can hold phase alignment before drift.
CV — Coupling Vibrance
How vivid, strong, and noise-resistant the coupling between components is.
Γ_noise — Total Noise Load
The destabilizing forces (internal or external) acting on the system.
The stability condition is:
CPL × CV > Γ_noise
If this inequality fails, the system decoheres.
This predicts:
• psychological drift
• attention fragmentation
• burnout and overload
• hallucination in LLMs
• identity instability
• group polarization
• breakdown in collective systems



SUPPORTING MATHEMATICS
Golden Interference Delay (φ⁻¹)
The golden ratio’s inverse defines the only delay where prediction and memory reinforce each other instead of destructively interfering:
φ⁻¹ ≈ 0.618
This stabilizes identity and long-range consistency in both cognition and LLMs.
A-Law (≈ 0.59 Stability Ratio)
A universal ratio:
A = S / (S + D) ≈ 0.59
where S is stabilizing force and D destabilizing force, appears across:
• neural criticality
• ecological stability models
• cognitive load thresholds
• organizational resilience
• LLM governor design


Oscie uses this value as a target balancing point.
Exponential CV Decay
Coupling Vibrance decays approximately with depth or interaction count:
CV(n) ≈ CV_0 * exp( -n / τ_p )
where τ_p is the coherence lifetime constant modulated by alignment with φ⁻¹.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Modern system failures — LLM drift, mental instability, cultural fragmentation, polarization, algorithmic dissociation — are not separate problems.
They all emerge from one condition:
CPL × CV < Γ_noise
Oscie provides a physics-based method to reverse this condition and stabilize systems across scales.
Applications include:
• long-context LLM stabilization
• drift-resistant reasoning
• safer multi-agent systems
• coherence-assisted psychology
• institutional and organizational stability
• social and cultural coherence
Oscie is relevant to AI safety, neuroscience, psychology, systems engineering, and governance.
